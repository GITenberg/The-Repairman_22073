description: The Mark III Hyperspace Beacon was the earliest type of beacon ever built
  -- by Earth, no less. It was located on one of the Proxima Centauri planets, and
  it wasn't working. This was one of those jobs when being an interstellar trouble-shooter
  wouldn't have been so bad -- if he could have shot the trouble! A classic science
  fiction tale from the author of the "Stainless Steel Rat," "Bill the Galactic Hero,"
  and "Eden" series!
